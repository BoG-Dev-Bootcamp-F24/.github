# Dev Bootcamp GitHub Org Guide

## Overview
Welcome to the Dev Bootcamp F24 Organization! This is where all the course lectures, exercises, and projects will live! Bootcampers will each have access to their own repositories where they can upload completed exercises and projects. An organization allows your work to be grouped together, so others can view it.
